    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this recipe, you will find all the ingredients and steps necessary to make a yummy pizza!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose or bread flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. (The warm water and sugar activate the yeast.) Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the salt, garlic powder, and half of the flour. Stir to combine. Add the warm water/yeast mixture and the olive oil. Use a wooden spoon to stir well, then gradually stir in the remaining cup of flour. Continue to stir until an elastic ball has formed, slightly sticking to the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Dust your hands with flour and knead the dough in the bowl for 3-5 minutes. If the dough becomes too sticky, gradually add additional flour in small dustings, up to 1/3 cup additional. If you poke the dough with your finger and it slowly comes back, it’s ready to rise. Shape into a ball.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a separate large glass bowl with a little olive oil and use a pastry brush to distribute the oil on the bottom and sides. Add the ball of dough. Cover with plastic wrap and allow it to rise for 30-60+ minutes, until doubled in size. (This gives time to for the gluten to develop, which allows the dough to stretch without breaking.) You can also let it rise in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450° F during the last 30+ minutes to ensure it has plenty of time to get fully up to temperature. Place the pizza pan (or stone) in the oven as it preheats.</li>
        <li>Gently punch down the dough and knead it 5 times to smooth it out.</li>
        <li>Spread the dough into an even 12-inch circle, either with your hands or with a rolling pin. (I also like to use my fingers to form a crust along the edge.)</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza pan from the oven and sprinkle it with a thin, even layer of flour. Transfer the dough onto it.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to gently poke holes in the dough to prevent the crust from bubbling up as it bakes. Drizzle it with 1 tablespoon olive oil and use a pastry brush to spread it out over the dough.</li>
        <li>Top with pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake for 13-15 minutes. Even if the cheese is melted, give the crust enough time to cook and crisp on the bottom, resist the urge to remove it too early, but don’t let it get too brown on the top. Mine takes 15 minutes exactly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and use a spatula to lift the crust to check the bottom, ensuring it’s slightly browned and crisp.</li>
    </ol>
